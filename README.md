# Chores
A program implementation in C++ to manage daily chores

IThe project is to implement a simple prototype for a program that can be used to handle a list of things/jobs/chores/etc that have some sort of level of urgency attached to them. For example one might have the following chores to do:

The idea is that the chores in the higher priority levels must be finished before the chores in the lower levels. If there are multiple chores in particular priority level, they must be finished in the order there were added to the level's chore list i.e. in FIFO (first in first out) order.

The number of priority levels might vary. In a list of houseworks like above three levels is probably enough. But there are situations in which more or less levels would work better. This hints to the directions that the priority list implemented in this project should probably allow the user to specify how many separate levels of priorities the list has.
